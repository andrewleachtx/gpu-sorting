# CSCE 435 Group project

## 0. Group number: 
Group 3

## 1. Group members:
1. Andrew Leach
2. Gage Mariano
3. Brian Nguyen
4. Anil Parthasarathi

## 2. Project topic (e.g., parallel sorting algorithms)
Parallel sorting algorithms

### 2a. Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)

- Bitonic Sort: Andrew
- Sample Sort: Brian
- Merge Sort: Anil
- Radix Sort: Gage

### 2b. Pseudocode for each parallel algorithm
- For MPI programs, include MPI calls you will use to coordinate between processes
- Bitonic Sort:
- Sample Sort:
- Merge Sort:
- Radix Sort:

### 2c. Evaluation plan - what and how will you measure and compare
- Input sizes, Input types
- Strong scaling (same problem size, increase number of processors/nodes)
- Weak scaling (increase problem size, increase number of processors)

### 3. Communication
Discord will be used as the primary means of meeting and communicating with everyone.
